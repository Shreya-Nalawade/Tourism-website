The website is built using Node.js and Express.js to create an effective and dynamic user 
experience. It consists of three main pages. The first page is the introduction page, where 
users are welcomed and prompted to tap on “Explore” to proceed. This action takes them 
to the second page, which is the packages page. Here, users can view six different travel 
packages, each with detailed descriptions and prices. Users can select any package that 
interests them and click on “Explore Now” to move to the next step. 
The third page is the contact page, where users are required to fill out a form with their 
personal information, including name, email, mobile number, and a message. Once the 
form is completed, users can submit it, and the information is stored in a MySQL database 
for further processing. 
The implementation involves setting up a Node.js server with Express.js to handle routing 
and server-side logic. The MySQL database is configured to store user information 
securely. The introduction, packages, and contact pages are created using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript to ensure a seamless and interactive user interface. The contact form on the 
contact page is designed to capture user data, which is then inserted into the MySQL 
database upon submission, ensuring that all user interactions are efficiently managed and 
stored.
